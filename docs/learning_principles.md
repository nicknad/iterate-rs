# Enhanced Learning Principles in ReflectOS

ReflectOS is built on established cognitive science frameworks to ensure that journaling isn't just a record of the past, but a tool for future growth. Below are the core techniques enforced by the application's architecture.

## 1. The Spacing Effect (Spaced Repetition)
The human brain forgets information at an exponential rate unless that information is reinforced. ReflectOS uses a "Summary Trigger" (every X weeks) to force the user to revisit old entries exactly when they are beginning to fade from active memory.

* **Application:** The app tracks the age of entries and prevents them from remaining "un-summarized" indefinitely.

## 2. Elaborative Rehearsal (Summarization)
Simply re-reading a note is "passive review" and has low retention value. ReflectOS requires **Summarization**, which is a form of elaborative rehearsal. By synthesizing multiple notes into one, the user must process the meaning and connect the dots.

* **Application:** The "Reflection Mode" provides a split-screen view to facilitate the creation of a new, higher-level synthesis of past data.

## 3. The Testing Effect (Active Recall)
By using **Category-Based Prompts**, the app moves the user from "free writing" to "active recall." Answering a specific question (e.g., "What was the most difficult conversation you had today?") forces the brain to retrieve specific memories, which strengthens the neural pathway more than a chronological log.

* **Application:** The Prompt Engine shuffles specific questions based on the selected Topic/Category.

## 4. Metacognition (Sentiment & Reflection)
Metacognition is "thinking about thinking." By providing local sentiment analysis and longitudinal summaries, the app allows the user to look at their own emotional and cognitive patterns from a distance.

* **Application:** Local ML models provide a "Sentiment Score" that helps users identify trends in their mental state over months or years.
