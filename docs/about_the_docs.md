# Documentation & Attribution Note

## LLM Usage Disclosure
The foundational architecture, ADRs, and initial design specifications 
for **Iterate** were generated with 
the assistance of a **Large Language Model (LLM)**. 
This approach was chosen to speed up intial documentation and to leverage AI capabilities.

## Living Documentation
While the current documentation provides a high-fidelity blueprint for the application, all documents are **viable for change**. 

As development progresses, these notes will be:
* **Refined:** To match technical realities discovered during implementation.
* **Updated:** To reflect changes in the .NET 10 ecosystem or Avalonia UI framework.
* **Validated:** By manual code review and real-world testing.

The "human-in-the-loop" principle applies here: the LLM provided the scaffold; the developer provides the final implementation and architectural integrity.
