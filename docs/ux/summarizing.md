# User Flow: Summarization Workflow

## Entry Point
Triggered automatically (stale entries detected)

## Steps
1. User is notified of pending summaries
2. Reflection Mode opens:
   - Left: old entries (read-only)
   - Right: new summary editor

3. User synthesizes insights
4. Summary saved as new entry

## Internal Behavior
- Old entries decrypted read-only
- New summary encrypted as independent record
- Original entries marked as summarized

## Outcomes
- Learning loop completed
- Reduced cognitive backlog

## UX Principles
- Gentle enforcement
- No data loss
- Clear progress indication
