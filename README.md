# Iterate

Iterate is a secure, local-first journaling application for Windows and Linux designed to facilitate "Enforced Learning" through spaced repetition.Unlike passive note-taking apps, Iterate actively prompts users to summarize past entries based on time decay and topic relevance, turning journaling into a tool for cognitive growth.
